# apachefs

``apachefs`` is a Python script which makes you able to locally mount a file tree served by Apache (like the [Heanet public mirror](http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/)). It's the default apache's behavior when it has to serve a file tree without any ``index.html`` file. The filesystem is obviously read-only.
